# better_together

Hi! We created this tool in response the NASA 2020 SpaceApps Challenge 'Better Together.' :rocket:

We were inspired to choose this challenge because we have a heart for eradicating inequality. We started with a team meeting where we verbally laid out what we wanted to achieve, then we created a kanban with user stories and routes. 

Our tech stack consists of JavaScript, Python, Flask, HTML, and Bootstrap. 

We deployed our website on Heroku. We encountered some hiccups when we ran into several git conflicts, but we were able to get together on zoom and iron them out as a team. We were excited to have the experience of coding as a team-- this was a first for many of us! 

In the future, we'd like to add user capability to the website so users can edit and delete their scenarios.
