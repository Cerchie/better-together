She believes most of the things she reads a little too much, and talks constantly about refugees and asylum seekers being responsible for all kinds of issues that exist in our society. It has gotten to the point where you can't even talk about find a new property to rent without her loudly blaming immigrants for 'leeching off of the government' and 'getting handouts'.  Her husband has had a difficult time finding a job after being laid off, and she fully thinks immigrants are responsible and have 'taken all the jobs'. How do you respond to these statements?",
